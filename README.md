This small project is for my application to the Junior Software Developer postion at Ksense Technology Group.

The app makes a GET request to the API jsonplaceholder and displays the recieved 'USERS'.
When a users selects one of the 'USERS' a GET request is sent to the API to retrieve the 'POSTS' made by that 'USER'.

A short css file is included to make the page responsive to different screen sizes and add some styling to the 'USER' table and post list.
